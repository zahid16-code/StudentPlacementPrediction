# StudentPlacementPrediction
## **📌 Mini Project: Placement Prediction Using Machine Learning**  

### **📖 Project Overview**  
This project aims to predict whether a student will be placed based on their academic performance, skills, and extracurricular activities. Using **machine learning models**, particularly an **ensemble classifier (Random Forest, Voting Classifier, etc.)**, we analyze key factors influencing placements.

---

### **🛠️ Features Used**  
The model considers **16 features**, including:  
- **Academic Performance**: CGPA, SSLC %, PUC %  
- **Technical & Soft Skills**: Aptitude test score, technical skills, communication skills  
- **Extracurricular Activities**: Internships, projects, workshops, research papers, hackathons  
- **Personal Traits**: Leadership, teamwork, soft skills rating  
- **Placement Preparation**: Training participation  

---

### **🖥️ Technology Stack**  
- **Python**: Data processing & model development  
- **scikit-learn**: Machine Learning algorithms  
- **Streamlit**: Web-based UI for easy interaction  
- **NumPy & Pandas**: Data handling  

---

### **🚀 How It Works?**  
1. **User Inputs Details** → Academic scores, skills, internships, etc.  
2. **Model Predicts Placement** → Based on historical data trends  
3. **Displays Result** → "✅ Placed" or "❌ Not Placed"  

---

### **🎯 Project Goals**  
✔ Help students assess their placement probability  
✔ Identify key improvement areas for better job prospects  
✔ Showcase ML model deployment using **Streamlit**  

Would you like me to enhance the UI or add visualization for better insights? 🚀
